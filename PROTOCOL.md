# Localtunnel Protocol

The Localtunnel Protocol (LTP) defines a lightweight protocol for a
client and server to establish a pool of connections used to proxy
connections from the server to the client.

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[1].

## Goals

* Allow TCP connections to flow from the server to the client, where the
  server acts as a reverse proxy and the client provides backend
connections
* Avoid overhead of multiplexing by using one backend connection to
  tunnel each frontend conection
* Separate control channel from proxy channels as separate connections
* Allow long-lived tunnel sessions with heartbeating

The protocol focuses on the interaction between a Localtunnel Server
Backend and a Localtunnel Client. It's implied but out of the scope of
this protocol the interaction between the other components. However,
it's important to know how the whole system works to understand the
function of this protocol.

The goal is to allow connections made by an arbitrary TCP Client to
connect to a TCP Server without direct network access. We assume a
Localtunnel Client can connect to a Localtunnel Server and the TCP
Server, and that the TCP Client can connect to the Localtunnel Server.

In order for a connection to be made from the TCP Client to the TCP
Server in this topology, the Localtunnel Client must first connect to
the Localtunnel Backend with a Control Connection. This represents a
tunnel session. It's used for setting up a tunnel and maintaining
heartbeats. In this connection, the Backend will dictate how many Proxy
Connections the Client should open to the Backend. These Proxy
Connections make up a pool of backends for the Localtunnel Frontend to
use as a reverse proxy.

Once a tunnel is established with a Control Connection and pool of at
least one Proxy Connection, the TCP Client can connect to the
Localtunnel Frontend. One of the Proxy Connections will be removed from
the pool and sent a signal for the Localtunnel Client to open a
connection to the TCP Server. The incoming Frontend connection will be
joined with the Proxy Connection on the Backend, and the Client will
then join the newly established connection to the TCP Server with the
open Proxy Connection.

Once these connections are joined, the connection is left alone for either
the TCP Client or TCP Server to close. 

We also assume the client will open a new Proxy Connection to the
Backend for every connection joined, maintaining a consistent Proxy
Connection pool.

This protocol addresses the interactions necessary on the Control
Connection and at the beginning of the Proxy Connection. This makes up
all the communication between the Localtunnel Client and the Localtunnel
Backend.

## Two Connection Types

When connecting to the Localtunnel Backend, there are two types of
connection modes: Control and Proxy. Both share a common sequence of
events:

1. Client sends protocol header and request message
1. Server asserts valid protocol header and reads message
1. Server sends response message
1. Preamble is over and connection either closes or goes into stream mode

The connection type is defined by the request message. 

### Control Connection

A control connection represents a tunnel session. The
preamble request contains properties needed for setting up a tunnel.
Stream mode is used for heartbeats until the client closes.

### Proxy Connection

A proxy connection represents a tunneled connection. The preamble
request contains properties to identify the tunnel it should be used
for, and to signal when to open a connection on the client side. Stream
mode is then used to proxy TCP traffic until either side closes.
